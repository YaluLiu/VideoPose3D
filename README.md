# 3D human pose estimation in video with temporal convolutions and semi-supervised training

This repository modifies the original repository for [cmu mocap data](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/). We generate 2d keypoints by projecting 3d 
skeleton from cmu mocap data with simulated multiple cameras. Most code are directly copy from [original repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D)
